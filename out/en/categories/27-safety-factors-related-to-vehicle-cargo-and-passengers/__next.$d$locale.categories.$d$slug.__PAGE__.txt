In the situation shown, the pedestrians are moving correctly on the pavement, i.e., in the place designated for them, and nothing indicates that they might suddenly step onto the carriageway. Therefore, there is no obligation to apply the principle of limited trust to them.","correct_answer":1,"type":"AB","official_number":11213,"license_categories":"AM","answers":[{"id":44173,"question_id":3429,"answer":"Yes","position":0},{"id":44174,"question_id":3429,"answer":"No","position":1}],"category":{"id":27,"name":"Safety factors related to vehicle, cargo and passengers"}},{"id":3448,"category_id":27,"media":"W16 20.mp4","question":"In this situation, should you adopt a cautious approach to the pedestrian?","points":3,"description":"","explanation":"Whenever the behaviour of another road user is uncertain, you should apply the principle of limited trust. In this situation, the pedestrian is standing at the very edge of the carriageway, and you cannot be certain of their intentions.

As this vehicle obstructs the view, it should be assumed that a worker may unexpectedly appear on the carriageway from behind it. This situation requires the application of the principle of limited trust.","correct_answer":0,"type":"AB","official_number":11409,"license_categories":"AM","answers":[{"id":44286,"question_id":3474,"answer":"Yes","position":0},{"id":44287,"question_id":3474,"answer":"No","position":1}],"category":{"id":27,"name":"Safety factors related to vehicle, cargo and passengers"}},{"id":3475,"category_id":27,"media":"12am.JPG","question":"In this situation, are you exempt from the obligation to apply a cautious approach to children, because they are in the care of an adult?","points":2,"description":"","explanation":"In accordance with the principle of limited trust, the driver is required to exercise special caution, especially in relation to children. Their behaviour, even when supervised by adults, can be unpredictable and sudden. The presence of a guardian does not guarantee full control over children, and therefore the driver is not exempt from the duty to anticipate their potential entry onto the carriageway.","correct_answer":1,"type":"AB","official_number":11412,"license_categories":"AM","answers":[{"id":44288,"question_id":3475,"answer":"Yes","position":0},{"id":44289,"question_id":3475,"answer":"No","position":1}],"category":{"id":27,"name":"Safety factors related to vehicle, cargo and passengers"}},{"id":3476,"category_id":27,"media":"15am.JPG","question":"In this situation, should you keep a close eye on pedestrians and adopt a cautious approach towards children?","points":2,"description":"","explanation":"There are pedestrians on the pavement, including two small children on bicycles.

The behaviour of children can be unpredictable, and they may run out into the carriageway at any moment. A parked vehicle further restricts visibility, which increases the risk that a child may run out from behind it directly into the path of an oncoming vehicle.","correct_answer":0,"type":"AB","official_number":11415,"license_categories":"AM","answers":[{"id":44292,"question_id":3477,"answer":"Yes","position":0},{"id":44293,"question_id":3477,"answer":"No","position":1}],"category":{"id":27,"name":"Safety factors related to vehicle, cargo and passengers"}},{"id":3552,"category_id":27,"media":"14-9.2021.mp4","question":"Should you be extra careful when driving at dusk and in cloudy conditions?","points":3,"description":"","explanation":"According to the Road Traffic Act, every driver is always required to exercise caution. The duty to exercise 'special caution', however, is imposed by the regulations only in specific situations, such as when approaching a junction, a pedestrian crossing, or when overtaking. Driving at dusk itself is not one of these statutorily defined situations, although it does require adapting your driving to the prevailing conditions.","correct_answer":1,"type":"AB","official_number":13100,"license_categories":"AM","answers":[{"id":44669,"question_id":3552,"answer":"Yes","position":0},{"id":44670,"question_id":3552,"answer":"No","position":1}],"category":{"id":27,"name":"Safety factors related to vehicle, cargo and passengers"}},{"id":3589,"category_id":27,"media":"egz_test(4).mp4","question":"When seeing the drunk person in this situation will you refrain from overtaking the vehicle?","points":2,"description":"","explanation":"The behaviour of an intoxicated person, visible on the left side of the carriageway, is unpredictable and may create an immediate hazard on the road. In accordance with the principle of limited trust, you should assume that the pedestrian may suddenly enter the carriageway.
